This is a harmless prank for Windows witch opens a pop up saying your computer is hacked and after that raises the volume to max and opens "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astely on Youtube. The perfect app to prank your friends!

Feel free to modify the code to your liking, but make sure you credit me if you are uploading it to the internet.

It Supports: Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8 and 8.1 and probably older versions but i havent tested it on them.
